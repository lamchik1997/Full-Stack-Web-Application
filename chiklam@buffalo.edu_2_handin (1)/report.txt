Objective 1:
To achieve this objective ,I choose to host my own webpage.I parse the path in the handle function and passed it to the function decode_content. Then, I started to analyze the path.If the path is equal to '\' or '\index.html'.It means that it is a root path. I will set the content_type to be text/html and set the request file to 'index.html'.Else if the path is ended with 'css' or 'js', I will set the content type to text/css or text/javascript respectively . Then I will read the requested file in read string mode and pass the content type and file_content to the Build_OK_response function, where it will call buildResponseFromByte function and build the response following the same format as HW1. Lastly it will encode the response and send the request to the server. 

Objective 2:
For this objective, we need to host the utf.txt file which containing some chinese character. In order to do this,I parse the path in the handle function and passed it to the function decode_content_byte . Then, I started to analyze the path.If the path not end with jpg and not end with ico, then I set the content type to be 'text/plain; charset = UTF-8". Then I will read the file that request in the path in READ BYTE mode. After that, I will pass the content type and file_content to the Build_OK_response function, where it will call buildResponseFromByte function and build the response following the same format as HW1. Lastly it will encode the response and send the request to the server. 

Objective 3:
For this objective, we need to host the image file which containing some images from the path images/<image_name> . In order to do this,I parse the path in the handle function and passed it to the function decode_content_byte . Then, I started to analyze the path.If the path is end with jpg ,then I set the content type to be 'image/jpeg'. Then I will read the file that request in the path in READ BYTE mode. After that, I will pass the content type and file_content to the Build_OK_response function, where it will call buildResponseFromByte function and build the response following the same format as HW1. Lastly it will encode the response and send the request to the server. 

Objective 4:
In this objective, we will need to serve the HTML webpage with the user required query string.First , I create a template.html with almost not element inside it expect for some placeholder.I will start to parse my URL link by calling my function (parseQuery). This will return a key-value pair with the requested query.I will edit the message by adding the corresponding value of the key:name in my message. For the requested images, I will loop through the value in the images key, for each value , I will add the img tag with corresponding value for image into message. Next I will write to template.html with my message.Then I will return back all the message to decode_content.Then I check to see if the path is start with "/images/" ,if so, I will set the content_type to be text/html and the request file is "template.html" .Then I will read the requested file in read string mode and pass the content type and file_content to the Build_OK_response function, where it will call buildResponseFromByte function and build the response following the same format as HW1. Lastly it will encode the response and send the request to the server.
